## Prerequisites

Before deploying the ModelServeAI, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place. This comprehensive platform requires several tools and services to be properly configured for successful deployment.

### Required Tools and Software

The deployment process requires several command-line tools and software packages to be installed on your local machine or deployment environment. These tools are essential for managing infrastructure, deploying applications, and monitoring the platform.

**Terraform** (version 1.5 or later) 

**kubectl** (version 1.27 or later) is the Kubernetes command-line tool needed to interact with the EKS cluster.

**Helm** (version 3.12 or later) is the package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment of complex applications like Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. Helm charts provide templated Kubernetes manifests that can be customized for different environments.

**AWS CLI** (version 2.0 or later) is required for interacting with AWS services and configuring authentication. 

**Docker** (version 20.10 or later) is needed for building and testing container images locally before deployment. 

**Git** is required for version control and accessing the project repository. 

### AWS Account Setup

Your AWS account must be properly configured with the necessary permissions and service limits to support the ModelServeAI. The platform creates numerous AWS resources across multiple services, requiring careful planning and configuration.

**IAM Permissions** are critical for successful deployment. The user or role performing the deployment must have comprehensive permissions including EKS cluster creation, VPC management, EC2 instance management, RDS and ElastiCache creation, S3 bucket management, IAM role creation, and CloudWatch access. It's recommended to use an IAM role with the necessary policies rather than root credentials.

**Service Limits** should be reviewed and increased if necessary. The platform may require higher limits for EC2 instances, particularly for GPU instances if using advanced features. VPC limits including subnets, security groups, and NAT gateways should be sufficient for the planned deployment size. EKS cluster limits and node group limits should accommodate your scaling requirements.

**AWS Region Selection** is important for performance and compliance. Choose a region that supports all required services including EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, and GPU instances if needed. Consider data residency requirements and latency to your users when selecting the region.

### Kubernetes Knowledge

Deploying and managing this platform requires solid understanding of Kubernetes concepts and operations. The platform leverages advanced Kubernetes features including custom resources, operators, and service meshes.

**Core Concepts** you should understand include Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress, and Persistent Volumes. The platform uses these fundamental building blocks extensively throughout the application stack.
